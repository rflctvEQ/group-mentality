## Description
Group Mentality is a full-stack forum application centered around promoting mental health. Users are able to read anonymous interactions between other users and mental health experts, and they are able to send in their own questions and experiences to receive advice from mental health experts. These experts (i.e. moderators) are able to see a list of pending user questions, edit and respond to them, or delete them if a similar interaction has already taken place on the site. 

### Future Development
In the future, Group Mentality will allow for a richer interactive experience between users and mental health experts (like notifications, the ability for moderators to tell users why their post has been rejected, etc.), and we'd like to provide users and moderators the ability to comment on forum posts. In the future, we'd also like to exchange the browser alerts for modals.
